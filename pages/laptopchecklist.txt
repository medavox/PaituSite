=====Laptop Checklist=====
Laptops always have something wrong with them, probably because of patents or something, or maybe just because HCI designers can't sit still, or stop reinventing the wheel (Windows 8, anyone? or perhaps Unity? or even Gnome 3?)

Here is a list I'm actively compiling, of things to check for before buying a laptop, to avoid buying dodgy ones.

A lot of these have been discovered from falling for these, so hopefully over time this list become more comprehensive, and I should buy less shoddy laptops.

=== Keyboard ===

  * Is the home-row intact?
    * is there a 3-wide, 2-down set of keys arranged thus:
    * insert, home, pgup
    * delete, end, pgdn?
  * are the arrow keys squashed, weirdly placed, or crowded by other extraneous keys?
  * is the keyboard British?
    * shift-3 = Â£
    * enter key is large
    * left of Z = \
    * left of 1 = `
  * Are the function keys accessible without Fn?
  * Is the CTRL key in the bottom-left of the keyboard?
  * Are there any caps-lock, num-lock, or scroll-lock indicators?
